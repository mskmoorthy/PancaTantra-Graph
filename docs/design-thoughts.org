* Use Cases

This section enumerates the use-cases for which we want to generate
graphs. These should guide the data representation we choose.

* System Design

  - Pick a declarative representation for the story facts we
    capture. (CSV) at present.
  - Representation should be independent of visual artifacts needed to
    draw graphs.
  - CSV data captures metadata.
  - Design data structures  (Python Classes) to hold this
    data. Character, Story (classes.py)
  - Instantiate objects by reading in CSV files. entities.py
  - Generate desired graphs from Python code that loads the data, then
    calls graphviz through the Python  API.
  - In effect, small Python programs produce any given graph-view of
    what is in the data.

    

* Modules 

  - classes.py :: Defines Character, Stories 
  - entities.py ::  Instantiates  --- Character, Story, ... from CSV data.
