* Desired Use Cases

This section enumerates the use-cases for which we want to generate
graphs. These should guide the data representation we choose.

* System Design

  - Pick a declarative representation for the story facts we capture.
  - Representation should be independent of visual artifacts needed to
    draw graphs.
  - Design data structures  (Python Classes) to hold this data.
  - Generate desired graphs from Python code that loads the data, then
    calls graphviz through the Python  API.
  - In effect, small Python programs produce any given graph-view of
    what is in the data.
